Program Description: This web application is a combination of 
                     several web apps. The use of Jquery's menu
                     function gives the ability to navigate to 
                     different website in this application.
                     There is a HOME in the menu, which is 
                     used to display instructions. There is 
                     a Weather in the menu to display weather
                     based on the location retrieved or entered.
                     And there is Computation in the menu that 
                     gives the user the ability to compute
                     either summation or fibonaci of number
                     entered.
                     The user can click the menu icon, which will
                     display three options as listed above. From
                     there, it is all up to the user. The program
                     makes use of a server to retrieve and display
                     the weather and to do computations. All that
                     is done on the client side is the layout/look 
                     and feel of the website.
